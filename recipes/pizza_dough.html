    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Easy, 6-ingredient vegan pizza dough from <a href="https://www.karissasvegankitchen.com/vegan-pizza-dough/">Karissa's Vegan Kitchen</a></p>
      <p>I use this recipe almost every time I make pizza at home.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
          <li>¾ cup warm water</li>
          <li>2 ¼ teaspoon active dry yeast</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon organic sugar</li>
          <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
          <li>2 tablespoon olive oil</li>
          <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
      <h3>The Dough</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Stir together warm water, yeast, and sugar. Let activate for 10 minutes - it should become foamy. If it's not foamy, then the yeast is may be too old or your water was too hot.
            <li>Stir in oil and salt.</li>
            <li>Mix in ½ cup flour at a time.</li>
            <li>Knead (using your hands or a dough hook in a stand mixer) until it forms a cohesive ball. It will still be a little sticky but you should be able to pick it up as one piece. If it's far too sticky, add 1-2 more tablespoons of flour at a time until it comes together.</li>
            <li>Continue to knead for 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Place the ball of dough into a large greased bowl. Cover with a towel and let rise in a warm location for 1 hour or until doubled in size. I let my dough rise in the oven with JUST the oven light on.</li>
            <li>Pre-heat oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit (make sure to remove the dough from the oven if you let it rise in there.)</li>
            <li>Punch the dough down and knead a couple of times until it becomes smooth and more firm. At this point, you can store the dough in the freezer or fridge until later...or make a pizza!</li>
        </ol>
      <h3>For Making Pizza</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Roll out the dough on a floured surface. Use your pizza pan for size reference (this recipe makes one 12-inch thick-crust pizza.)</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the pizza pan with a pinch or two of flour and transfer the dough onto the pan. Work the dough to fit the edges.</li>
            <li>Brush the dough with 1-2 tablespoon of olive oil (this helps the top of the dough stay moist and not overcook.)</li>
            <li>Poke the dough all over with a fork - this will prevent the dough from puffing up.</li>
            <li>Pre-bake the dough for 5-7 minutes or until the bottom is just barely beginning to brown. At this point, the pizza should be able to lift out of the pan with a spatula.</li>
            <li>Remove from the oven, brush the crust with 1-2 tablespoons of melted vegan butter, and add your toppings.</li>
            <li>Bake for an additional 10-15 minutes or until the crust is golden brown and the toppings are cooked through.</li>
        </ol>
