    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Easy, 1-bowl, cut out vegan sugar cookie recipe from <a href="https://www.karissasvegankitchen.com/vegan-sugar-cookies/">Karissa's Vegan Kitchen</a></p>
      <p>No chilling required!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <h3>Sugar Cookies</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup vegan butter softened (226g)</li>
            <li>1 cup sugar (200g)</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla</li>
            <li> 3 cups all-purpose flour (360g)</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons cornstarch (24g)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Icing</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups powdered sugar</li>
            <li>3-6 tablespoons vegan milk</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>food coloring, sprinkles, etc for decorating</li>
        </ul>    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 325°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Cream together vegan butter, sugar, and vanilla in a large bowl using a mixer or wooden spoon.</li>
            <li>Mix in the flour, cornstarch, baking powder, and baking soda. At first, the dough will present as a sandy texture but will come together to form a cohesive dough. You may need to use your hands to squish the dough together.</li>
            <li>Form the dough into a ball. Roll it out to be about ¼-inch thick. I like to roll out my dough between two sheets of parchment paper to prevent the dough from sticking to the counter.</li>
            <li>Cut out the dough using cookie cutters.</li>
            <li>Transfer the cookie dough cut outs to the baking sheet. Bake for 8 minutes.</li>
            <li>Sometimes bubbles will form on top of the cookies. When fresh out of the oven, gently smooth out the top of the cookies with a spatula to create a flat surface.</li>
            <li>Let cool completely before frosting.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Icing</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Using a mixer or a whisk, combine the powdered sugar, 3 tablespoons of the milk, and the vanilla. Add more milk if needed to get the consistency you need.</li>
                <li>Add food coloring if desired.</li>
            </ol>

    <h2>Notes</h2>
        <p>If the dough is too crumbly and not forming into a ball even when using your hands, add a teaspoon of vegan milk. The dough should not be sticky at all.</p>
